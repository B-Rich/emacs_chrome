About
=====

Emacs Chrome is an extension for Google's Chrome(ium) browser family
that allows you to edit text areas on your browser in a more full
featured editor. It does this by sending an XMLHttp request to an edit
server (see servers/ directory) which spawns and edit process which
eventually sends the updated text back to the browser.

I use it to edit pages using Emacs although there is no reason why
other editors could not be spawned from the various scripts.

History
=======

Dave Hilley [1] wrote the original proof of concept that showed it
could be done. I [2] then hacked around with the Javascript to make
the behaviour more like the classic It's All Text add-on available to
Firefox.
