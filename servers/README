Servers
=======

Because the Chrome(ium) security model doesn't allow for extensions
spawning processes we can't just exec() the editor process. Instead we
have to implement an "edit server" which listens to XmlHttp requests
on port 9292 (default) and then sends a response when the edit is
complete. A number are included here:

* pycl.py - Original version, works
* edit_server.el - An Emacs Lisp implementation, under development (patches welcome)
